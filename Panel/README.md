The Polivoks.svg file contains details of the panel layout I used for my module with the labelling in Russian to give the most authentic Polivoks feel.

Polivoks_EN.svg has the equivalent labelling in English.

Both files show (in grey) the positions of the sockets and potentiometer mounting pads I used in my build. Delete these along with the black background and the mounting hole positions if you intend to get white waterslide transfers printed.

Note that you may need to convert the text objects to paths before sending them to be printed commercially.
